In this tutorial, we've explored a Python script for automatic schema generation in PySpark. 
The script leverages PySpark's 
StructType and StructField to dynamically create a schema based on the data types of a given pandas DataFrame. 
This automation is particularly useful for large-scale data processing tasks on Databricks, 
where efficient schema management is crucial
    for performance. The script provides flexibility, allowing you to handle DataFrames with 
or without column names. 
With just a few lines of code, you can significantly simplify your PySpark workflows and 
enhance the maintainability of your data processing pipelines.
